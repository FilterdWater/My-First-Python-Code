Don't even know anything about the Python ecosystem and what I would use the programming langauge for but seeing [Astral's](https://astral.sh/) tools gets me excited.

Creating super simple stuff following Bro Code's course is a nice change of pace too.

For some reason I needed a moment to be able to walk through the code on line 5 topic 13, so getting it was nice.
